$ stack new arty-blinker clash-lang/simple
$ cd arty-blinker

edit .gitignore to contain the line:
/vivado/build/

And we should make the following part of the starter project's .gitignore:
/stack.yaml.lock

$ mkdir vivado
$ cd vivado

<This next line is stupid. We accidentally broke something with the way you>
<are supposed to do it.>
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/v1.8.1/clash-lib/data-files/tcl/clashConnector.tcl

Write the files vivado/synth.tcl and vivado/synth.sh from scratch

Get Synopsys Design Constraints for your board, like
https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc/blob/master/Arty-A7-35-Master.xdc
and customize that into vivado/Arty-A7-35-BlinkerClockWizard.xdc

Write your Clash source, this repo has a blinker

stack build

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then every time you want to make a bitstream from source:

stack run -- clash -Wall --verilog Blinker
vivado/synth.sh
